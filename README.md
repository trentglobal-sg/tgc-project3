The color chosen is in a greyscale palette in line with a minimalist look and feel. Merino wool apparel are often in natural wool colors in greyscale tones as it is often not ideal to dye the fabric without affecting its natural anti bacterial properties.

#### Fonts
Vanillate font is chosen for the company logo for its clean, bold cursive for a casual, stylish and clean look.

HurmeGeometric font 3 is chosen for the website body for its versatility and suitability for fashion e-commerce websites.

#### Icons
